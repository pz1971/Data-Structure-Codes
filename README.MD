**Codes for University Data-Structures and Algorithms Courses**
---
- This repository contains the codes of Data-Structures course.
- Tried to implement all the codes with templates as much as I could so that they can deal with any kind of data.
- Most of files are in C/C++
- Existing files may have been updated over time if they need more optimization or any kind of bug-fixation.
- Day to day, Newer files will be added to this repository since, I'm not done with learning (learning never ends).
- Any kind of suggestions are welcome.
